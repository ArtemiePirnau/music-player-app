# Description

That's a pet project

Music Player - are a number of songs that you can listen to. You can move the songs forward or backward using the arrows, you can still move the cursor anywhere in the song and it will continue to play.

There are 3 ways to listen to songs:
* Playlist Looped - the songs are in order
* Song Looped - the song was repeated
* Shuffled playback - songs go in random order

You can add the song to favorites or delete it from there
